This is an angular frontend to transform and display data from API.

The data from API shows the info about bands. It shows festivals, blow that it shows all the bands attended to it, and blow that it show what record label the band belongs to.

This frontend reverses the data structure. It starts from record labels, blow that it shows the bands belong to that record label, and blow that it shows all the festivals the band has attended.

This frontend only contains one page, which display the data before and after transformation.
